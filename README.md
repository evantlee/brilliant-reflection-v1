# Reflection Sandbox

An interactive visualization tool to help learners understand reflections and virtual images in optics.

## Overview

This project provides an intuitive, step-by-step visualization of how light rays form virtual images through reflections. Users can:

1. Place objects in a room with configurable mirrored walls
2. See virtual rooms and objects created by reflections
3. Place an observer to view the virtual images
4. Trace rays from virtual objects to the observer
5. Watch as virtual rooms fold back to show the actual light path

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository URL]
cd reflection-sandbox

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## How to Use

The application guides you through a step-by-step process:

1. **Place Objects**: Click on the grid to place an object. Click on walls to toggle them as mirrors (they'll turn cyan when mirrored). [NOW API CONFIG]

2. **Virtual Rooms**: Once you've placed objects and configured walls, proceed to see virtual rooms generated by reflections. You can adjust the maximum reflection order using the slider. [NOW API CONFIG FOR ORDER + STEP BUTTONS TO GO UP/DOWN IN ORDER]

3. **Place Observer**: Click outside the original room to place the observer (purple circle). [NOW API CONFIG]

4. **Ray Tracing**: Click on a virtual object to draw a ray path to the observer.

5. **Folding Animation**: Step through each reflection from the virtual image to get to the path the light actually takes in the mirrored room.
